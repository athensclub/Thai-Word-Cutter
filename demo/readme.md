# Thai Word Cutter Demo
This is a server-client web-based demo for the Thai word cutter project. The client will take thai string as input, send the string as a request to the server. The Server will then apply tokenization method using this project's model, and response back to the client with the tokenized strings of word, which client will then display to the user.
